# SINE AI Code ü§ñ‚ú®

**SINE AI Code** is an innovative AI-powered code generator that allows you to prompt, run, edit, and deploy full-stack web applications directly in your browser. Inspired by tools like `bolt.new`, SINE AI Code aims to streamline the development process by leveraging artificial intelligence to generate code and provide an online environment for execution and modification.

**Live Demo:** [https://sine-ai-code.vercel.app/](https://sine-ai-code.vercel.app/)

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
